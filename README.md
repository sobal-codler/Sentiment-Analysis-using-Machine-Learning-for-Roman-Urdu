# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-for-Roman-Urdu
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for detecting abusive or offensive language in Roman Urdu text. The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of identifying negative or harmful comments. This work is being undertaken as the final year project for my Bachelor’s degree at the Virtual University of Pakistan.


# Roman Urdu Sentiment Analysis 📝

This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis of Roman Urdu text** using **Machine Learning techniques**.  
It involves preprocessing text data, feature extraction, and applying classification algorithms to predict sentiments such as **Positive** and **Negative**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, removing duplicates, stop words, and special characters).
- Normalization of text data.
- Custom **Roman Urdu stopwords list**.
- Feature extraction using:
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)**
  - **N-Grams (Unigram, Bigram, Trigram)**
- Classification using:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud**.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection** → Roman Urdu dataset (tweets with sentiment labels).  
2. **Preprocessing** → Handle missing values, duplicates, lowercase conversion, stopwords & special character removal.  
3. **Feature Extraction** → TF-IDF and N-Gram modeling.  
4. **Model Training** → Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest.  
5. **Evaluation** → Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
6. **Visualization** → WordClouds and plots for better insights.

## 📈 Results
- Models were evaluated and compared based on accuracy and performance metrics.  
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among tested algorithms.
