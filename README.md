# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-for-Roman-Urdu
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for detecting abusive or offensive language in Roman Urdu text. The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of identifying negative or harmful comments. This work is being undertaken as the final year project for my Bachelorâ€™s degree at the Virtual University of Pakistan.
